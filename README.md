# George's Board Games Review App

This app was put together during the frontend project phase during my times at Northcoders Bootcamp.

## Summary

This app displays reviews for various board games, a list of which can be seen by following the "Reviews" tab at the top of the page.
These reviews can be sorted by date, comment count or number of votes, and toggles between ascending and descending order.
You can also view reviews for each game category.
Each individual game review can be accessed by clicking on the relevant board game card, which will give more information to the user about that review. Each review can be up or down voted once only.
A comment can also be left on each review, and there is the option to delete your own comment if you wish.
